# Back-end for ERP system
This repo contains the code to deploy an Express.js implementation of the back-end of an ERP system developed for a small real-state management office designed to be hosted on a cloud service.

Most table and query names are in Spanish, but in general this back-end is mostly an API to access a MongoDB instance.
